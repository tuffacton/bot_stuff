        "Some bots have more idealistic motivations. The [NYPD Edits Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/NYPDedits) stemmed from a [Politico article](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2015/03/edits-to-wikipedia-pages-on-bell-garner-diallo-traced-to-1-police-plaza-087652) detailing how computer users at NYPD's headquarters may have editted articles about alleged police brutality. That being said, the bot has a more objective function than the article, stating that it simply tweets when anonymous Wikipedia edits originate from a list of particular IP ranges that happen to be correlated to NYPD headquarters. Full code for the project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/edsu/anon) as well."

        "\n",
        "However, where the ethical aspect comes in is when information that is normally not obtained easily becomes centralized, as demonstrated by the NYPD Edits bot. While the NYPD Edits, is constructed from public data generated from Wikipedia, the average layman does not have the technical aptitude to connect the dots and therefore the bot allows the public to see what had to be done manually.\n",
